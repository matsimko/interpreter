# Interpreter

This is an implementation of a parser and interpreter of a simple C-like language which supports:
- literals and variables: `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `string`
- statements:
	- `;`
	- `type variable, variable, ... ;`
	- `expression ;`
	- `read variable, variable, ... ;`
	- `write expression, expression, ... ;`
	- `{ statement, statement, ... }`
	- `if (condition) statement [else statement]`
	- `while (condition) statement`
- expressions: arithmetic, logical, and relational operators; assignment operator; and string concatenation operator

The parser (generated by [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) based on a grammar) builds a parse tree which is first walked with the use of listeners to check for syntactic errors and then to perform type checking. If there are no errors, the tree is traversed by a visitor to generate stack-based instructions which can then be run by the interpreter.
